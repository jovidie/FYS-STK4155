    In this project, I have studied three regression methods, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Ridge and Lasso, and compared their performance on synthetic and real terrain data. I found that the choice of method relies on the problem to be solved, and that the OLS method is sufficient when using noise free synthetic data from the Franke function. When introducing noise to the function, Ridge regression performed better as it did not overfit the data. I also performed a bias-variance trade-off analysis, using resampling methods such as bootstrap and cross-validation, and found the optimal polynomial degree for the input data.
